## Data Visualisation using R

In partnership with UNDP, the BioHolistic Database project was initiated to establish Seychelles' national biodiversity database system. 

Understanding that streamlined data storage and management underpin sophisticated data analytics, I facilitated a session on R-based data visualization as part of an extensive 4-day training workshop. The content herein reflects materials from my presentation, tailored for biologists and NGO representatives in Seychelles at the forefront of environmental advocacy.

## Key Highlights:

Database Overview: Insights into the BioHolistic Database.

Data Management: Best practices in field data collection, review, and management.

Interactive Session: Hands-on experience with data entry on the new platform.

Visualization: Delving into R techniques for biodata visualization.

Feedback Round: Collaborative dialogue on refining the system.
