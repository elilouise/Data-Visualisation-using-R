## Data Visualisation using R

In partnership with UNDP, the BioHolistic Database project was initiated to establish Seychelles' National Biodiversity Database system. 

Recognizing that proficient data storage and management are prerequisites for advanced data analysis, I contributed to a broader 4-day training workshop by delivering a presentation on R-based data visualization. This repository contains materials I prepared for that session, the session was aimed at biologists and NGO representatives in Seychelles who are deeply involved in the environmental sector.

Key Points:

Database Introduction: Understanding of the BioHolistic Database.

Data Management: Best practices, field data collection, and review.

Hands-on: Direct data entry testing on the new system.

Visualization: R techniques for visualizing biodiversity data.

Feedback Session: Collaborative system improvement discussions.
